* Add 6 fold torsion
* add weighted torsion for fitting function
* Test fragmenter on drugbank database (dont paramterize until the rest of POLTYPE torsion is complete)
* Add multiple conformers for multipole fitting
* Allow ring torsions to be puckered and obtain QM data for torsion paramterization
* Allow 2D dihedral scans to fit a tor-tor coupling term too for torsions that are adjacent to each other. Numerical spline should be used for functional form of tor-tor.
* Add support for AMOEBA+ parameters
* Add automated vdw QM surface scan from water probes.
